It is a colab notebook for finetuning stable diffusion by textual inversion. This colab notebook is being run on free tier colab. 
You just have to upload some photos and choose whether you want model to learn about the style or object and it will be finetuned. 
I have uploaded some versions of this on SD concepts of library. Here is the link https://huggingface.co/sd-concepts-library/small-iconss , https://huggingface.co/sd-concepts-library/minii-iconss , https://huggingface.co/sd-concepts-library/icons . 
You can try my finetuned model through the Run_the_SD_concepts_library notebook. You just have to put the link to my finetuned concepts in the notebook.
